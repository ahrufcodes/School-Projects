# Hepatitis Classifier

In this project, I aim to build a hepatitis classifier using machine learning techniques. I started by exploring the dataset and performing data preprocessing. The dataset contains various features related to hepatitis, and our goal is to predict whether a patient has hepatitis or not.

I preprocess the data by transforming the target feature into a binary class (0 or 1) and visualize the data using the provided plot_grid() function with the help of the seaborn library.

Next, I trained and optimize two different machine-learning models using cross-validation. I compared the performance of these models by evaluating them using confusion matrices and precision-recall plots. This analysis helped determine the accuracy and speed of the models and provides actionable insights.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries to be installed:

- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn


### Installation

1. Download the zip file containing the Hepatitis Classifier project files from the repository.
2. Extract the contents of the zip file to your desired location.

### Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- README.md: this file.
- hepatitis.csv: the dataset used in the project.
- hepatitis_classifier.ipynb: the main Python script that loads the dataset, preprocesses the data, trains the model, optimizes the model, and evaluates the model.
